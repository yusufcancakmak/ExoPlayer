# ExoPlayer

ExoPlayer is a media player used in Android applications. 
It was developed as an alternative to the MediaPlayer API used by Android to play audio and video both locally and over the internet.
ExoPlayer supports many different features such as DASH and SmoothStreaming adaptive playback features that are not supported by Android's MediaPlayer API.
Unlike the MediaPlayer API, ExoPlayer is easier to customize and use.
